#Demo data README
There are use limitations for the example data (e.g. three-dimensional models) provided with this code for curve skeletonization.  The models may be used for evaluation and debugging purposes of the code, and used in published work for evaluations of curve skeletonization algorithms so long as the source paper

(free, identical in content, version -- arXiv (arXiv:1702:07619[cs.CV] [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07619.pdf)) is acknowledged as the source of the model.  It is not necessary to compare using the authors' method in this case.  However, outside of these situations, use of the model in published materials or 3D printed works is not permitted by this public release and authors interested in alternate uses should contact the authors for permission.
